    "# Introduction \n",
    "This notebook is intended to provide a concise introduction to Python. At the same time, it should serve you as first contact to Jupyter notebooks. I will assume that you are already familiar with programming and, therefore, this notebook will focus on Python-specific stuff. Due to the intended conciseness of this tutorial, you should pay attention, since some things will be directly presented in the code. A suggestion: when doing exercises don't copy code, retype it to familiarize with the syntax. \n",
